                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
                <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
                <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
                    Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.</p>
                <h3>Anatomy of a CSS rule set</h3>
                <p><b>Selector:</b> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, p elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</p>
                <p><b>Declaration:</b>This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code> It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>
                <p><b>Properties:</b>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the p elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>
                <p><b>Property value:</b>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>
            </div>
        </Container>
