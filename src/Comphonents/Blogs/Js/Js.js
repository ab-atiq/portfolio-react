                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>
                <h3>What is JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).</p>
                <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
                <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </Container>
    );
