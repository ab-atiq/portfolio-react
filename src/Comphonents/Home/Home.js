                        I'm a web developer from in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. I’m currently the react developer. In my spare time I like working with a few select clients and building my own products.
                        <br />
                        My most recent product is Airplane. It’s a simple service and commerse website.
                        <br />
                        You can usually find me on Twitter, but I'm occasionally on Product Hunt and Reddit as well.
